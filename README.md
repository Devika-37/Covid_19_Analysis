Project Title: COVID-19 Analysis in Asia

Description:
This project focuses on exploring and visualizing the impact of COVID-19 across Asian countries using Python. The dataset includes time-series data of confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques were applied to clean, filter, and analyze the dataset, isolating records specific to Asia.

Key steps involved:

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handled missing values and standardized country names.
Filtering Asian Countries: Extracted relevant entries using region metadata.
Aggregated Metrics: Calculated total confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries per country.
Ranking: Sorted and selected the top 20 Asian countries based on confirmed cases.
Visualization:
Bar plots and pie charts using Matplotlib and Seaborn
Trendlines to show case growth across time
Heatmaps to display severity distribution
Tools Used: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

This project provides insights into how different Asian countries were impacted, enabling better understanding of trends, severity, and recovery progress.
